The templates are classified in terms of the language and the purpose.

## Contents

- **Slides:** Template to write a presentation in Beamer. This template is a very customised version of the Dresden theme. 

- **Report:** Template to write a report in latex. This template uses the ```fancyhdr``` package. It includes several templates for a title page and a package with all the maths commands that I use.

- **Thesis:** Template to write a thesis in latex. This template uses the ```fancyhdr``` package. It includes a package with all the maths commands that I use.

- **CurriculumVitae:** My curriculum vitae in English. Based on a template from [latextemplates.com](http://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae).
