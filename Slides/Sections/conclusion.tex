\subsection{}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{enumerate}		
		\item The Ising model arises in physics, and it is also studied in computer science because of its interesting complexity properties.
		
		\vspace{3mm}
		\item \textbf{Main problem:} complexity of approximating $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G; y, z)$.

		\vspace{3mm}		
		\item When there is no external field ($z = 1$): 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Complexity of exact evaluation is fully classified.
			\item Complexity of approximation: 
			$\# \mathsf{P}$-hardness is not fully characterised.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\vspace{3mm}
		\item When there is an external field ($z \ne 1$):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Only one result was known: case when $y$ and $z$ are roots of unity.
			\item We have made progress when $|y| < 1$ or $y$ is a root of unity.
			\item For $|y|\ge 1$ and non root of unity, the complexity is unknown.
		\end{itemize}
